BUGFIX D v1.6.0

Changed beeper pulse for aftermarket dial boards (40uS instead of 20uS)
Tuned display driver interrupts and timings(no visible difference - for compatibility purposes)
Manual button tuning CAT hook has been restored, so CAT changes are reflected in manual button tuning mode
and visa-versa.

Changelog v0.3b

TX fixed. PLL strobing was going too fast and portB data wasn't getting latched correctly
Bug fixed where EEPROM would save too often
Reimplemented split and clarifier.
Out of band TX beep (if front panel switch is in non-wideband position)
CB mode lockout if non-widebanded
Mic buttons now working as follows:

In VFO mode:
Up/down - slow increment
Up/down + FAST fast increment
FAST = Mhz increase (looping)

In MR mode:
Up/down - Channel up/down.
FAST - back to VFO mode

In CB mode:
Up/ Down - Channel Up/Down
FAST - Toggle CB band (either UK or FCC/CEPT ( UK mid band)

Hold VFO A/B to reset EEPROM at any time. Listen for the beeps.

CAT implemented with following extra commands in addition to the standard yaesu commands:

XX XX XX XX FF - Reboot radio / processor
XX XX XX XX FE - Reset EEPROM and reboot
XX XX XX XX FD - Toggle CB mode or previous mode (VFO or MR)
XX XX XX XX FC - Instant Temporary Wideband. Will unlock all frequencies and CB mode, regardless of front panel switch position, UNTIL NEXT REBOOT!!!

Dial acceleration refactored

CAT radio transmit update: Not yet live, but we are going to use UART1 (Pin C6 - which is Mic down button. So you can provide your own ingenuity for access)
Mic button will STILL WORK, however if MIC DOWN button is pressed while radio is transmitting the serial data, it will not reach the computer. There will probably
be a lockout for the MIC DOWN button when sending serial data. I'll decide later.

Other notes for source code readers:
Added EEPROM movef, swapf and copyf functions

More to be added once I remember...


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Changelog:

v0.2b
Mic buttons now working. 
Up/Down = 1kc...
FAST + Up/Down = 100kc... 
FAST by itself = MHZ UP. Will loop over. So after 30mhz, will go to 0.
PLL calculations hopefully all correct now

v0.1b
Initial release. Pretty buggy. Some PLL calculations forgotten. This release should be discarded

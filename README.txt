This project has a SLIM PITCH of 0.070 inches(1.778mm) Standard 2.54mm (0.100) pitch pins will NOT FIT.
I made and tested an adapter board but it was in the way of the morse keyer switch PCB, so has been discarded.

OEM gerbers: No programming header or pads. It is assumed programming will be handled by external clip or pre-programmed prior to fitting
DIY gerbers: Pickit 3 compatible header (2 sided boards/NON TSSOP) or pads (TSSOP version) supplied for your convenience. There is a little LNK jumper to link after programming (MCLR-GND)

DIY flush mount board added. This uses a PIC16F737-I/SS TSSOP package. Can be surface mounted to existing through-holes, pins not required (just fill the holes with solder)
    Fit to same side as original IC.

TESTING: Inverted DIY flush board added. This is the same as the flush board apart from everything is inverted. This is designed slim enough to fit underneath the VFD display!
    Do not attempt to fit this to the NON-DISPLAY SIDE! It will not work.

TESTING: The TMS1_TH gerber is for a through-hole version of the PIC16F737 IC (PIC16F737-I/SP)

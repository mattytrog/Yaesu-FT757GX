READ THE README_FIRST FILE NOW PLEASE!!!

The gerbers are the same, apart from the OEM does NOT have a built-in PIC flashing header and is meant for people who require pre-built units.
The TMS1_TH gerber is for a through-hole version of the PIC16F737 IC
NEW: Slimline flush fit board added. 2 versions. Both include programming headers. Only difference is routing. V2 possibly routed a little better (less vias). This uses a PIC16F737-ISS TSSOP package. Can be surface mounted to existing through-holes, pins not required (just fill the holes with solder)
The DIY gerber has a Pickit 3 compatible programming header. There is also a little solder jumper to apply once programming is complete.

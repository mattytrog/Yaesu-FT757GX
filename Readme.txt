ANY FURTHER UPDATES WILL BE AFTER CHRISTMAS NOW. IN MEANTIME, PLEASE TRY DIFFERENT VERSIONS IF PROBLEMS, BUT I "THINK" THE SOFTWARE IS MOSTLY COMPLETE NOW.
CHECK OUT THE FT757GX USER GROUP ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE INFO, VIDEOS AND COMMENTS.

UPDATES FOR 2024 ARE FINISHED. WE STILL HAVE 50% OF ROM AND 75% OF RAM FREE IN THE CPU PIC, SO PLENTY MORE FEATURES TO COME.
IF A MAJOR BUG COMES TO LIGHT, ILL UPDATE BEFORE XMAS.

MERRY CHRISTMAS AND A HAPPY NEW YEAR.

God Bless

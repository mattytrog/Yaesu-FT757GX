Fitting and construction notes
-------
The shaft on the ENS1J encoder is wider and shorter than original. Care must be taken when refitting VFO knob. It may need slight adjustment. To make things easier, you can extend the shaft with some 7mm tube

The front hole will require being drilled by 1mm (or 2) as the ferrule/collar assembly on ENS1J is 1mm wider

V1.1 boards:
------------

It can be beneficial to fit the wires from the encoder / chip side. The silk screen for JST / headers is on the solder side, however its better to fit them
to the component side, which isn't marked with silkscreen

Nidec Copal encoders are not supported on v1.1 boards

V1.2 boards:
-

Nidec Copal encoders are supported. These require 10k pullup resistors in the positions shown on the PCB. Mount in original dial board location
Silkscreen changed to preferred side
Programming / debug more accessible once fitted to radio

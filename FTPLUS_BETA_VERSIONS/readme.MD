v1.5.0 Proposed changes (included in above HEX and BLHEX files)

New combined codebase, supporting FTMinus and FTPlus, switchable in source. Source has not been published yet.

New app, allowing configuration of FTPlus and management of memories. (Windows app or Linux in Wine).
When app is running and the "magic packet" has been received, FTPlus stays at 4800 baud until the app, which I've called "Configurator"
is exited and radio is powered on and off.

Baud rate is now changed by holding down M>VFO and manually choosing a baud rate, by rotating dial or pressing UP / DOWN.
Confirm your option by pressing M>VFO again.

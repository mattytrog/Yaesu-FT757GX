What is this?
-
This is a replacement CPU for the FT757GX transceiver by Yaesu.

ENSURE YOUR CPU IS FAULTY BEFORE REPLACING IT WITH THIS!!!  

v1.4.5a Changelog
-
All CB bands are now supported, from super super LOW to super super HIGH, as well as UK 27/81.    
Full automatic CAT mode switching. Its now no longer necessary to change to Kenwood mode, or Yaesu mode.    
CAT should now auto-initialise on the first try.   

This is automatic. Just make sure BAUD rate is correct (and stop bits etc) and you are good.   
CAT pause feature added.  
Further optimisations. Lots of uint32 removed, giving substantial reduction in space.  
Bugs fixed.  
Bugs added (probably XD).
